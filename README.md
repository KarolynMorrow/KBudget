# KBudget
Capstone Project

For my project I will be doing a budgeting app to assist those that are not familiar or comfortable with doing their own budget. By implementing authentication, users will be able to create an account allowing specific them the authorization to their personal budgets. Users will have the ability to add multiple bills, income, and savings information. A calendar will be updated each month and or with each input added to keep the user up to date throughout the current month. With the ability of auto calculations, no human error will cause mishaps within your budgeting experience.
